# ArduinoHeater-Receiver

##Control your ancient baseboard heater wirelessly!

If you're like me and live in an old building with a baseboard heater, you can now control the heat remotely.

This project consists of two parts:
- Receiver end: a NEMA stepper motor, Arduino, thermostat and wifi module
- Controller end: Touchscreen, Arduino, wifi module.
